# All about credit-cards for contractors & freelancers

### Q 1. How do I get my first credit card?
Ans - Getting your 1st credit card is tricky business because you don't have a credit history yet. If you are a freelancer/contractor, it is even harder. However, there are some tricks to the game:
* Reach out to your own bank first - Don't directly jump at your favourite credit card. If you don't have an account with the concerned bank, it is possible that your application will get rejected. Call up your bank or your RM and ask them if they have a pre-approved card for you. However, this is not guaranteed to work. In my case, Axis bank rejected my credit card application even though I had an account with them for 4 years at that time.
* Get a FD-back credit card - Some banks may be willing to offer you a credit card that is backed by a Fixed Deposit. In this case you lock your money with the bank and they offer you credit card whose limit may be 80-110% of the Fixed Deposit.
* Try smaller banks like IDFC - Applying with a smaller bank or neo-bank may increases your chances. This however comes with risks of privacy invasion. Some of these apps won't let you apply for a credit card unless you let them read your SMS' so that they can determine your creditworthiness based on bank's sms.
* Fintech solutions like OneCard/Unicard/Slice - These apps give you out loans in the form of a credit card. There's nothing wrong about that but it's good to know this before you apply. 

Once you get your 1st credit card, you can start building your credit history by buying wisely and paying bills on time. Download the OneScore app from appstore to keep an eye on your credit scores. After 4-5 months of building a credit history, you can then apply for your favourite credit card. This should improve the odds of getting one but again, it is not guaranteed.
